# Testing

### Types of Testing

**UNIT TESTING** is the practice of testing small pieces of code, typically individual functions, alone and isolated. If your test uses some external resource, like the network or a database, it’s not a unit test. These are usually relevant to engineering and beneficial to the product because the users will see fewer errors.
- great for preventing regressions – bugs that occur repeatedly


**INTEGRATION TESTING** As the name suggests, in integration testing the idea is to test how parts of the system work together – the integration of the parts. Integration tests are similar to unit tests, but there’s one big difference: while unit tests are isolated from other components, integration tests are not. For example, a unit test for database access code would not talk to a real database, but an integration test would.
- useful for situations where unit testing is not enough
